My name is Justin Arqies Giles, I was born in Clarksdale,MS on March 25, 1998. Graduating high school twice, I am considered not your ordinary person. Also serving as Clarksdale High School’s class of 2016 Valedictorian, I consider myself to be an intelligent young man. I aspire to become a neurologist as a result of my great grandmother having Alzheimer’s,my passion for science, and helping people. Attending Tougaloo College in the fall, I’m devoted to making the most out of this experience and driving myself to accomplish many achievements.
